# LED
Arduino code collection for customization LED project.

LED is the most basic electronic element. However, as the experience grows, you might counter some situation that uses LED strips, LED matrix, and LED spotlight to build the system. Newbies assume it is an easy task because blinking LED is the simplest Arduino project, and running 5 LEDs is the second Arduino project for most people. How to control a LED strips in customized colors, patterns and how to make it happen in an efficient way? Luckily I have a chance to create a series of interactive sculptures using LED strips and LED spotlights. I'd like to document all the useful codes, technics, and mindset.
